# 🧠 Loominus MCP

**A self-hosted, node-based visual builder for AI-native workflows.**  
Download. Connect. Automate. No cloud. No code.

> ✨ Like Figma meets LangChain — fully offline, agentic, and customizable.

## 🔒 Privacy-First, Always

Loominus MCP is a downloadable desktop app that runs 100% locally.

- No telemetry  
- No cloud sync  
- Bring your own LLMs, APIs, agents, or local tools  
- Configure memory, context, sensors, and models — your way  

Use OpenAI, Claude, HuggingFace, LM Studio, or llama.cpp.  
Control lab devices, trigger local scripts, or build pure digital agents.  
**Everything is node-configurable. Everything is yours.**
