## 🔥 Why Loominus MCP?

MCP tools and servers are exploding across the open-source world. But unless you're deep in YAML, gRPC, or Python... it’s hard to build anything fast.

**Loominus MCP solves that.**

It’s a visual interface for **wiring together agents, LLMs, APIs, tools, sensors, and data sources**—all powered by MCP.

Whether you're hacking a personal assistant, running autonomous experiments, or building AI-first apps, Loominus MCP gives you full orchestration power without touching a line of code.
