**Visual Node-Based Builder for Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers & Agents.**

## 🔥 Why Loominus MCP?
 MCP tools and servers are exploding across the open-source world. This advancement promises universal inter-connectivity with the digital (software, APIs) and the physical world (sensors, instruments, machines).
 
 > ⚡ However, it is  confusing and often hard to build anything fast. We believe that what is missing is a local, self-hostable client that allows you to configure and share MCP servers (public or private) and MCP-powered agents in a very clear and intuitive way. 

**Loominus MCP solves that.**

It’s a visual interface for:
- **configuring & sharing public and private MCP servers just with 1 click**
-  **wiring together MCP servers/tools with LLMs** to create agents and automation workflows for anything you can imagine as long as there is an MCP server for that 

> ⚡ We’re on a mission to democratize intelligence tooling for hackers of the digital and the physical world.
