# 🧬 Loominus MCP

**The self-hosted visual builder for agentic workflows using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).**  
Build, orchestrate, and automate AI-native systems — visually, locally, and privately.

## 🧠 What Is It?

Loominus MCP is a **desktop app** that lets you wire together LLMs, APIs, memory systems, agents, sensors, and tools via a drag-and-drop visual interface.

It’s the first **visual front-end for MCP tools and servers** — empowering anyone to build agentic workflows without code, cloud lock-in, or complexity.

> Think: **Figma or Unreal Engine, but for orchestrating intelligent workflows.**

## 🔒 Privacy-First & Local by Design

- Runs **100% locally** on Windows, Mac, or Linux
- Bring your own API keys (OpenAI, Claude, llama.cpp, etc.)
- Connect local files, private docs, scientific instruments, etc.
- No telemetry, no tracking, no cloud sync — ever

---

## 🛠 What Can You Build?

- Multimodal research agents with RAG & memory  
- LLM-powered assistants that summarize documents or trigger tools  
- IoT-connected workflows for DIY labs or smart spaces  
- Multi-agent collaboration frameworks with context sharing  
- Self-running experiments using tools + Bayesian optimization  

→ [See Example Workflows](./docs/examples.md)

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🎛️ Visual node editor — no YAML, no code  
- 🔌 Connect to *any* MCP server (open source or custom)  
- 🧩 Prebuilt node libraries: memory, tools, agents, LLMs, IO  
- 🧠 Memory & context chaining, with live agent visualization  
- 🧾 Workflow export/import for sharing and publishing

---

## 🛤️ Roadmap

Here’s what we’re actively building (with community input):

- [x] Cross-platform app for local execution  
- [x] Core node engine with visual graph editor  
- [ ] **Node Marketplace** — discover & share node packs  
- [ ] **Local LLM support** (llama.cpp, LM Studio, etc.)  
- [ ] **Multi-agent routing + messaging**  
- [ ] **Agent observability layer** (trace IO, memory, context)  
- [ ] **Web-exportable workflows** (like Figma share links)  
- [ ] **Node-level auth scopes + sandboxing**  
- [ ] **Loominus Labs SDK** — node packs for hardware (BioLoom, MetaLab, etc.)
