# 🧬 Loominus MCP Agent Marketplace

Welcome to the official Loominus MCP Agent Marketplace — a growing collection of modular, agentic tools designed to power local and autonomous workflows via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Loominus MCP is a visual, node-based IDE that lets you design and deploy intelligent agents across your lab, research, or creative environments—fully local, privacy-respecting, and interoperable with public or personal MCP servers.
